        <p>
            A statement of purpose is a written essay that showcases your academic background, research interests and career goals to the admissions committee. Its main objective is to demonstrate how your skills, experience and aspirations align with the specific program you're applying to, and how the program will help you achieve your academic and professional objectives. Essentially, it's your opportunity to tell the admissions committee why you're the right fit for their program and why their program is the right fit for you.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="p3">How to write a statement of purpose?</h2>
        <p>
            Before writing your statement of purpose, thoroughly research your desired programs and schools to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand their mission statements and align your values with theirs.</li>
            <li>Identify faculty members whose research interests match yours, and note their work.</li>
            <li>Show how your goals and values align with the program's, demonstrating a strong fit.</li>
            <li>Consider reaching out to potential faculty mentors for collaboration.</li>
            <li>Carefully follow each school's specific guidelines, prompts, and word counts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This will help you tailor your statement of purpose to each program, increasing your chances of a successful application.

        <h2 class="p3">How to structure a statement of purpose?</h2>
        <p>
            Before writing your statement of purpose, researching your desired programs and schools to understand their mission statements is essential. Your statement should cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHAT:</strong> Your academic background, accomplishments, research questions and goals.</li>
            <li><strong>WHY:</strong> Your motivations, why this program and why these professors.</li>
            <li><strong>HOW:</strong> Your plan for finding answers, utilizing program resources and contributing to the field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While there's no one "correct" structure, most statements follow an intro-body-conclusion pattern. The intro should clearly state your intentions, while the body provides specific evidence of your qualifications, fit with the program and goals. Be specific, thorough and show that you've done your homework.
        </p>
        <p>In the main body:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Address your academic and professional preparation.</li>
            <li>Show your fit with the program's mission and values.</li>
            <li>Discuss your strengths, weaknesses and career plans.</li>
            <li>Specify what you propose to study and with whom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For doctoral programs, demonstrate your ability to contribute original work to the field. Naming professors whose work aligns with yours is crucial and researching their work thoroughly will help you demonstrate your seriousness about the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep your statement concise, focused and tailored to each program, using your transcript, resume and letters of recommendation to support your application.

            intro: "",
            description: "In the realm of commerce, the role of mathematics is undeniably significant, particularly in fields such as finance and accounting. However, the commerce sector is vast and multifaceted, offering numerous career opportunities for those who may not have a strong inclination toward mathematics. Many individuals with diverse skill sets and interests can find fulfilling careers in commerce that do not primarily rely on mathematical prowess.One prominent career path for those less inclined toward math is marketing and sales.This field thrives on creativity, strategic thinking, and strong communication skills.Marketing professionals are responsible for developing strategies to enhance brand awareness, attract customers, and drive sales.They craft compelling campaigns and analyze market trends to tailor their approaches effectively.Sales executives, on the other hand, focus on engaging directly with customers to understand their needs and offer suitable products or services.Both roles emphasize interpersonal skills and strategic planning over numerical analysis.Human Resource(HR) management presents another avenue where mathematical skills are not the central focus.HR professionals are integral to recruiting, training, and managing employees.Their roles involve fostering a positive work environment, handling employee relations, and implementing development programs.An HR managerâ€™s primary responsibilities include overseeing recruitment processes, resolving conflicts, and ensuring employee satisfaction.These tasks require strong organizational and interpersonal skills rather than advanced mathematical knowledge.Business administration is a broad field that encompasses managing business operations and strategy.Business administrators are responsible for overseeing the day- to - day functions of a company, ensuring that operations run smoothly and efficiently.Project managers, who fall under this category, plan and execute projects, ensuring they meet deadlines and stay within budget.Although some aspects of business administration involve financial oversight, the focus is more on organizational skills, strategic planning, and leadership.Public relations(PR) is another dynamic field where mathematical skills are not essential.PR professionals manage and enhance the public image of individuals or organizations through strategic communication.They develop communication strategies, handle media relations, and coordinate events to promote a positive image.The role of a PR specialist requires creativity, effective communication, and media savvy rather than numerical aptitude.Entrepreneurship offers a thrilling career path for those who prefer not to focus heavily on mathematics.Entrepreneurs start and manage their own businesses, which involves a blend of creativity, risk - taking, and business acumen.While some aspects of running a business involve financial management, the core skills needed for entrepreneurship include innovation, problem - solving, and strategic thinking.Entrepreneurs often wear multiple hats, from marketing and sales to operations and customer service.Management consulting is a field that involves providing expert advice to organizations to help them improve performance and solve complex problems.Management consultants analyze business issues, develop solutions, and recommend strategies for improvement.This role relies more on analytical thinking and problem - solving skills than on mathematical calculations.Consultants must understand business dynamics, industry trends, and organizational behavior to offer valuable insights. Finally, international business presents opportunities for those interested in global trade and cross - cultural interactions.This field involves managing and conducting trade between countries, requiring an understanding of global markets and cultural nuances.International business managers oversee operations and strategies for businesses in international markets, while export/import coordinators handle logistics and documentation for cross-border trade. The emphasis here is on global strategy and cultural awareness rather than advanced math.In conclusion, while mathematics is a crucial component in many commerce - related careers, it is not a prerequisite for success in the field.The commerce sector is rich with opportunities that value other skills and attributes, such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, and interpersonal skills.By exploring these diverse career paths, individuals can find rewarding and fulfilling roles in commerce that align with their strengths and interests, proving that a passion for commerce does not necessarily require a strong focus on mathematics."
